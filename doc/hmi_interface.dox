 * @image html hmi_sero_1.png

 * This image shows the graphical Human-Machine Interface (HMI) used to control the SERO robot arms.
 * The GUI is implemented in Python using the ImGui library (pyimgui + OpenGL) and communicates with MoveIt via ROS.

 * Key elements:
 * - On the left: selection of the active planning group and a button to move to the predefined home pose.
 * - In the center: fields to define relative and absolute Cartesian motions (TCP-based).
 * - On the right: a live image of the selected robot, current TCP position, and movement confirmation.
 * - Below: button-based incremental movement in XYZ and RPY space.
 *
 * The GUI is designed for real-time feedback and fast manual positioning during development and testing.
